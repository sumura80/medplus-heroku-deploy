          <p class="text-muted">Life Abroad (the “Company”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service.<br><br> 

          For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Company’s service which can be accessed via our website at https://lifeabroad.jp, at which users can obtain information about products for sale in Japan, ingredients in those products, and information about various public systems. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company. “You” refers to you, as a user of Service. By accepting our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (found here: https://lifeabroad.jp/html/others/terms.html ), you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

            <div class="card-body text-muted">
              We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes only your email, which you submit to us through the registration process at the Site.<br><br>

              <p>1. Information collected via Technology </p>
              To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, the Company may use cookies to collect the following information:<br><br>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Determine which domain to measure</li>
                <li>Distinguish unique users</li>
                <li>Throttle the request rate</li>
                <li>Remember the number and time of previous visits</li>
                <li>Remember traffic source information</li>
                <li>Determine the start and end of a session</li>
                <li>Remember the value of visitor-level custom variables</li>
              </ul>




              <br><br>
              The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. For example, we store a persistent cookie to track users and sessions.<br><br>
